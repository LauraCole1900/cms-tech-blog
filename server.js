// Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the express-handlebars package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

// You’ll also need the dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.

// Note: The express-session package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.

// GIVEN a CMS-style blog site
// WHEN I visit the site for the first time
// THEN I am presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in
// WHEN I click on the homepage option
// THEN I am taken to the homepage
// WHEN I click on any other links in the navigation
// THEN I am prompted to either sign up or sign in
// WHEN I choose to sign up
// THEN I am prompted to create a username and password
// WHEN I click on the sign-up button
// THEN my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site
// WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in
// THEN I am prompted to enter my username and password
// WHEN I am signed in to the site
// THEN I see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out
// WHEN I click on the homepage option in the navigation
// THEN I am taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created
// WHEN I click on an existing blog post
// THEN I am presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment
// WHEN I enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in
// THEN the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created

// WHEN I click on the button to add a new blog post
// THEN I am prompted to enter both a title and contents for my blog post
// WHEN I click on the button to create a new blog post
// THEN the title and contents of my post are saved and I am taken back to an updated dashboard with my new blog post
